Defining goals is a very important step for any learning journey, but usually we just don't give it the right importance. Clear and very well written goals can lead to success and keep you motivated while learning complex topics.

How many times did you started to learn something and quit? How many times did you finished an online course and after some time you just forget about what you learned? Are you really using the best approach? Did you ever stop a second to think about what you are doing wrong? And the most important question of allâ€¦ Are you defining your goals and plan your learning right?

To help you, I will give you two master tips to boost your learning process!

# Tip 1: Make your goals SMART

In order to make your goals smart you must make them having the following characteristics:

1. <span style="color:black; background-color:white;">**S**</span>pecific - clearly defined and specific
2. <span style="color:black; background-color:white;">**M**</span>easurable - quantifiable and trackable
3. <span style="color:black; background-color:white;">**A**</span>chievable - realistic and within your capabilities 
4. <span style="color:black; background-color:white;">**R**</span>elevant - aligned with your values and overall objective
5. <span style="color:black; background-color:white;">**T**</span>ime-bound - has a specific deadline or timeframe

# Tip 2: Use bloom's taxonomy

Mastering a subject often requires a significant investment of time and effort. While common sense suggests a progression from understanding to application, Bloom's Taxonomy provides a more structured framework for categorizing cognitive learning levels. By understanding and applying this taxonomy, we can set more effective learning goals and tailor our study strategies to achieve mastery.

**Bloom's Taxonomy** is a framework that categorizes cognitive learning objectives into six levels, ranging from simple recall to complex creation. By understanding and applying this taxonomy, you can create more effective learning goals and strategies.

Considering the different levels above, we can realize that just by doing a quick online course probably will not help you to master any topic. In order to achieve excellence it's required to define your targets in a way to cover all these different levels of thinking. 

# Example: Getting your goals right

Let's say that I want to improve my knowledge in multithreading computing and want to define a goal. 

A poor option would be (too generic):

> I want to master multithreading computing.

A better version of it would be:

> Develop a concise, informative presentation on multithreading concepts and their practical applications, including real-world examples and potential challenges, to help colleagues improving their problem-solving and optimization skills. Successfully deliver the presentation to colleagues and achieve an average questionnaire score of 80% or higher. Allocate sufficient time for research, presentation preparation, and practice. Complete the presentation and questionnaire evaluation within one month.

On this example Level 1 and 2 from the bloom's taxonomy hierarchy are covered. We could now define new ones to aim higher levels and improve our understanding.
