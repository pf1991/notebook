# Building a Blog with Jekyll & GitHub Pages

This blog documents my journey through software development. It's built using Jekyll, a static site generator, and hosted on GitHub Pages.

# Getting Started

- [Config github pages and Jenkyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll)
- If you are using Zettlr to write content it's required to adjust images urls: 
    - use `assets_urls_to_jenkyll.sh` before any commit 
    - use `assets_urls_to_zettlr.sh` to see images again on Zettlr 
- Run locally with `bundle exec jekyll serve`
